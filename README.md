In this work, I have applied two machine learning al- gorithms Logistic Regression and Gaussian Naive Bayes, and three deep learning algorithms Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). 
Dataset: The dataset utilized in this study was obtained from the Kaggle website and comprises around 150,000 e-commerce transactions. The dataset has a total of 151,112 transactions, of which 14,151, or 9.36%, are identified as fraudulent transactions. All of the data provided is synthetic in nature.

The key findings derived from this work:
1) Deep learning algorithms (ANN, CNN, GANs) perform better than traditional Machine learning algorithms (LR, NB) in credit card fraud detection.
2) The CNN and GAN both provide a good balance between precision and recall, making them potentially suitable for scenarios where missing fraudulent transactions is costly.
3) The objective of reliably detecting credit card fraud, while minimizing the occurrence of false positives, necessitates the use of a model that exhibits high accuracy and a favorable trade-off between precision and recall. The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) demonstrates considerable potential as a viable option among other models.
